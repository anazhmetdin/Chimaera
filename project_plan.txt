Dr. Tamer's description:

  - Extracting discordant paired end reads
  - Extracting reads with multiple mismatches of linear alignment
  - Extracting reads with supplementary alignment that are correlated with structural defects
  
  - Based on the results of the above three points:
    - If those reads are supported by enough evidence, higher than an arbitrary threshold, we would perform QC on those reads to decide if the refrence needs to be updated or the reads should be discarded.


Negm's part:
  
  - Extracting reads with supplementary alignment that are correlated with structural defects:
      Parcing SAM/BAM files with Samtools, [bash script], to extract reads with falgs satisfying Q9 and/or Q12.
  
  - Storing those reads in a suitable data structure [c++ code]:
      hash table would be in the size of the primary reads. Each read would be converted from a string to an integer, then, that integer would be hashed to a unique index. Each index would point to a tree of different representative reads.
  
  - Exploriring loci with structrual variants [c++ code]:
      output a file containing a report of each locus, including the range of the longest continous reads of starting and ending positions, with the list of reads names
