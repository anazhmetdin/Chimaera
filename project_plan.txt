Dr. Tamer's description:

  - Extracting discordant paired end reads
  - Extracting reads with multiple mismatches of linear alignment
  - Extracting reads with supplementary alignment that are correlated with structural defects
  
  - Based on the results of the above three points:
    - If those reads are supported by enough evidence, higher than an arbitrary threshold, we would perform
    QC on those reads to decide if the refrence needs to be updated or the reads should be discarded.
